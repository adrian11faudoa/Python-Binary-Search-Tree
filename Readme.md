A BST is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node


You can create an instance of a class in Python like this:

Example Code:
```
    object_name = ClassName()
```


 In-order traversal is a depth-first binary tree traversal algorithm that visits the left subtree, the current node, and then the right subtree.
